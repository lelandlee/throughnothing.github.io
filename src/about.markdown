# About Me
- - -

Hi there. I'm William Wolf, a software developer living in San Francisco. I love to
[read](/reading.html), travel, [code](https://github.com/throughnothing),
[write](http://blog.throughnothing.com), [photograph](https://flickr.com/throughnothing),
and just generally enjoy time with friends and family.

I currently work as a Payments Engineering Manager at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com).
