        <p>I like Biking.  I&#39;m drawn to the simplicity and elegance of the bicycle.  I&#39;ve
been biking to work pretty regularly (read: whenever its above 35 degrees), for
a while now, and I love it.</p>

<p>One way to make biking even simpler is to get rid of the gears.  I&#39;ve been
looking for a decent bike to turn into a single speed for a while, and finally a
deal came up on craigslist that I couldn&#39;t pass up...and it was already a single
speed.</p>

<p>I rode it to work and back twice this week (12 miles each way), and I&#39;m loving
it.  It is definitely a little more strenuous at times, but its so simple, and
you never have to think about changing gears.  When you&#39;re on a single speed,
the only thing you can do is pedal, and maybe that&#39;s the way it should be.</p>

<p><strong>The best Christmas gift you can give is your time.</strong> Your friends and family more than likely have everything they really need, but what they often may not get enough of is your time. Spend time with them. Quality time. Listen to them. Laugh with them. Let them know you are there for them.</p>

<h2>Gifts are just more stuff</h2>

<p>Stuff that most of us don&#39;t need. If you have money you&#39;d like to get rid of during the Christmas season, give it to a charity, or someone genuinely in need. Explain to others what you are doing, and even link back to this post if you think it will help them see why quality time and good company are better than any gift.</p>

<h2>Time is the most valuable commodity in the world</h2>

<p>Sharing some of yours with others means more than that iPad, golf club, or purse you could buy them (and its better for the planet as well). Stop reading blogs and go share your time with someone special. You won&#39;t regret it. Go. Now.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Running should be free, man.</p><footer><strong>Christopher McDougall</strong></footer></blockquote>

<p>Barefoot running (and running with minimalist footwear) is a rapidly growing trend today.  Encouraged by Christopher Mcdougall&#39;s Born to Run, and activists such as Barefoot Ken Bob and Barefoot Ted, the movement really seems to be taking off. When I first heard about barefoot running earlier this year, I was very skeptical. People don&#39;t REALLY run barefoot, do they?!</p>

<p>Yes, they do, and I now count myself amongst their growing ranks. I can tell you from personal experience that running barefoot has changed my life. I truly believe that it can change yours too.</p>

<p>You see, before March of this year I was not a runner. I couldn&#39;t tell you the last time I had run (for fun anyway), and I certainly didn&#39;t enjoy running. If you had told me then that I would be in love with running in just a few short months, I certainly would have laughed.</p>

<h2>How Fast Things Change</h2>

<p>As I write this today, not only am I in love with running, but in October I finished my first marathon (which I will write more about shortly) -- and Iâ€™m looking forward to running more!</p>

<p>How did I go from docile couch potato to a running addict? The real secret for me was barefoot running.</p>

<h2>Why Barefoot Running?</h2>

<p>Simply put, barefoot running is wonderful. It releases your inner child and makes you feel like a kid again. Barefoot running allows your body to teach you how to run the way you are designed to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced that the main thing preventing most people from running is that they don&#39;t enjoy it. This was certainly true for me. I had tried running in the past but just never found it fun. Barefoot running changed this for me completely.</p>

<h2>Steps to Running Barefoot</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in barefoot running, you&#39;ve already got everything you need to get started (great news for all you minimalists!). I will just provide some simple steps that I&#39;ve learned from my own experiences running barefoot.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start Slowly. Very slowly. Seriously, you can&#39;t go too slowly. Your feet have likely been in shoe-casts for many many years, and your muscles and bones have probably atrophied to an extent. It will take some time to get them strengthened to where they need to be before you begin putting a lot of raw mileage on your feet. Too much too soon and you pulling muscles, tearing up your soles, and even stress fractures in your feet. I can&#39;t stress this point enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Love it. This should come pretty easily, but if it doesn&#39;t, stop and figure out why. If you aren&#39;t enjoying it, really don&#39;t continue until you find the joy in it. You don&#39;t want to run miserably anyway, right?</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t Push Yourself. When you or your feet feel tired, stop. You don&#39;t want to overwork your feet, and once you start pushing yourself, you may lose the enjoyment. If you resolve to call it a day once your body tells you to, you&#39;ll be able to continue to get in good runs day after day and enjoy every minute of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t measure your progress. Counterintuitive, I know, but people often get too obsessed with their mileage and their times. Just focus on your body and learn to understand what it is telling you. This will improve your form and help increase your distance naturally over time at a pace that your body can handle. Measuring how far you run may cause you to become frustrated, or to try to push yourself to do too much too soon. Avoid this by not using a gps, stopwatch, or other measuring device. This will also help keep your mind clear and enable you to achieve flow in your running.</p></li>
<li><p>The rest will come naturally. If you follow the 4 steps above, the rest will fall into place. Your mileage will increase, your form will improve, and you will be loving it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully this short introduction to barefoot running will motivate you to get out there and start enjoying running. Remember to take it slow and make sure you are having fun.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Patience is something you admire in the driver behind you and scorn in the<br/>one ahead.</p><footer><strong>Mac McCleary</strong></footer></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems as if many of us dread our morning commute. We don&#39;t
even like to think about it -- all the traffic, the stopping, the starting,
the rushing, the worrying. But it doesn&#39;t have to be this way.</p>

<p>You can enjoy your commute. It will take some lifestyle adjustments, some
time, and a re-thinking of your routine, but you can do it. Below are five
steps that you can use to start improving and enjoying your commute today.</p>

<h2>1. Wake Up Earlier</h2>

<p>By far the number one thing you can do to make your commute more enjoyable
is to wake up earlier. They say that time is money, but time is also
happiness. How often do you have time to simply sit, and enjoy the morning?
Waking up earlier gives you the time to clear your head, relax, and get
ready at your own pace. Instead of getting dressed while guzzling down your
morning coffee, sit down and just sip. Maybe you can even observe a
beautiful sunrise without worrying about being late.</p>

<p>Of course, you don&#39;t want to wake up earlier at the expense of losing even
more sleep (I&#39;m assuming that you aren&#39;t getting enough already), so you
will need to find ways to go to bed earlier. Cutting out some TV or internet
browsing at night is well worth the extra sleep you&#39;ll get, and certainly
worth the calm, relaxed morning you&#39;ll have the next day.</p>

<h2>2. Bike (or Run/Walk) to Work</h2>

<p>I started biking to work about a year ago, and my only regret is not doing
it sooner. For some of you this may not be an option if you live too far
from work, but if you&#39;re close enough, give this a shot! You&#39;ll love it.
Biking to work is exhilarating, like being a child again. It&#39;s great for the
environment, your body, and your wallet.</p>

<p>It may take you longer to get to work this way (you&#39;re getting up earlier
now, right?), but you&#39;ll be having fun, enjoying the outdoors, and avoiding
the stresses of your old commute.</p>

<p>Get out of your metal box, and experience the world on your next commute!</p>

<h2>3. Eliminate Advertisements and Background Noise</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re one of the lucky ones who can do number two above, then you&#39;ll
already have this one covered (don&#39;t wear headphones while biking/running!).
For the rest of you, try to limit -- or eliminate completely -- your
exposure to advertising during your commute. I think many of us keep the
radio on for background noise -- to keep our mind numb during the drive.
Stop doing this. It can be a distraction from your driving, and it doesn&#39;t
help clear your mind, or reduce your stress. If your mind needs something to
chew on, roll down a window and listen to the sounds of the world around
you, it&#39;s really much better than whatever your favorite radio host is
rambling on about, and you may be surprised by how much you enjoy this.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to be bombarded by advertisements and talk show hosts pushing
their interests on you. Without these distractions, you&#39;ll give your mind a
rest, and you&#39;ll likely be more focused on your driving.</p>

<p>If you really can&#39;t stand having the radio off completely, try to stick with
some CDs or music from an mp3 player. That way, you can choose music that
you know you like, and avoid the commercials and radio static.</p>

<h2>4. Go Slowly</h2>

<p>Since you&#39;ve woken up earlier, you now have enough time to get to work, so
go slowly. Take your time. Enjoy the trees changing colors, the squirrels
playing, the colors of the early morning sun. You may even notice beautiful
things in your own neighborhood that you hadn&#39;t seen before (I know I did).
Don&#39;t get angry when someone cuts you off, just let it happen, knowing that
you&#39;ve got plenty of time to get where you&#39;re going.</p>

<h2>5. Be Present. Breathe.</h2>

<p>Going slowly will help you to be present. Try to be completely present and
aware of each moment as it slips by. Be aware of your surroundings. A great
way to focus right now is to simply breathe. Breathe in and out. Pay
attention to each breath and the movement of the breath throughout your
body. At first it may be difficult to stay focused, but over time it will
become more natural, and you&#39;ll look forward to your commute as a calm,
mind-clearing start to your work day.</p>

<p>If you practice these steps regularly, you&#39;ll begin to look forward to your
commute. Your commute will become a form of mental preparation for the day
ahead, free of the stress, worrying, and rushing.</p>

<p>How are you working to improve your morning routine and commute?</p>

<p>I was re-reading an old
<a href="http://www.ridiculouslyextraordinary.com/101-life-lessons/">blog post</a> by
<a href="http://www.ridiculouslyextraordinary.com/">Karol Gadja</a> over at Ridiculously Extraordinary about life lessons, when one item on his list suddenly stood out and got my mind working.</p>

<h2>Successful People Read Books</h2>

<p>Its true. In fact, after reading it, it seems so obvious, but its something I hadn&#39;t thought of in this way before. I follow a lot of bloggers who (I think) write very well and are successful, and almost all of them seem to devour books pretty regularly.</p>

<p>Of course, this all makes perfect sense. Reading expands our knowledge base, and introduces us to new, creative ideas. Reading also helps expose us to different writing styles and different cultures -- both of which can improve our own writing.</p>

<p>Those who read regularly are keeping their minds active and constantly bombarded with new experiences, thoughts, questions, provocations, and images. Under these circumstances it would be hard for the mind to not pop out a unique idea of its own.</p>

<p>If you want to be a well-rounded, successful, thought-filled individual, turn off the TV and pick up a book. What are you reading today?</p>
