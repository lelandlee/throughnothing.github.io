#Hi, I'm William Wolf

I'm a geek that loves technology, philosophy, economics, cryptocurrencies,
health, and generally all things voluntary.

I love to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7295031-will).  
I sometimes [write](http://blog.throughnothing.com) and
[tweet](https://www.twitter.com/throughnothing).  
I push code to [GitHub](https://github.com/throughnothing).
