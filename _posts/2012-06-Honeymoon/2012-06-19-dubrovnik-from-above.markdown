After a lazy (and late) start to the day, we managed to get out and
get breakfast in the old town just before noon.

We ate pretty quickly, and then found our way to one of the palaces in the old
town.

As we walked back through the old town, it began to fill with people, and
music.  Lots of street musicians came out and were filling the main walkways
with mostly classical music.  There was classical guitar, violin duos and trios,
and more.

Walking around a bit we discovered there was a farmer's market today in the old
town, so we checked it out and picked up some fruit and nuts to have at the
hotel and to carry with us for snacks.

After dropping our purchases off at the hotel, we were ready for 'lunch'.  We
stumbled upon what would be one of our favorite restaurants: Dubrokva.  Lunch
was delicious (and yes, Angelle ordered pizza in Croatia...).

We dicided to venture out beyond the old town walls after lunch and see what
existed out there in the rest of the Dubrovnik.  The answer is: not much.  We
did however manage to find the lift which takes you up to the top of the hill
next to Dubrovnik, and got to see some of the most amazing views of the city,
Lokrum, the island just off-shore, and the Agean Sea.

We stayed on top of the hill for a while, just taking in the view.  There was
an amazing breeze, and the weather was perfect.  The lift stays open late (until
midnight, I think) so you can stay up there pretty much as late as you want.
But we finally decided to head down before dark.  On the way down from the
hill, I spotted the Dubrovnik fire station, so, of course, we *had* to stop
by and get a photo!

Exhausted from a not-so-long-but-leisurly day in Dubrovnik, we head back to the
hotel. Once we get there, we realize we're hungry but don't feel like going out
for a full (and time-consuming) dinner, so we decide to try the sandwich shop
across the street from the hotel.  Delicious burgers and hot dogs for a very
reasonble price (with wine!) followed.
