We've started the daunting task of boxing up all of our worldly posessions into
small, easy to carry (hopefully), boxes.  When you start taking all of your
belongings out of their closets, drawers, shelves, and cabinets, it really
becomes daunting just how much stuff (and junk) you have.

Angelle and I were both ready to purge a bunch of stuff we haven't used and get
rid of stuff we really don't need/use, which really helps. Also, as we started
putting the boxes of all of our stuff in the living room, and watching it build
up to see just how much we have, it became a self-motivator to really get rid of
things we don't absolutely need or love.

We got rid of a lot of kitchen stuff we've never touched, some
pictures/paintings that we didn't really love enough (or at all...why do we even
have these!?), and we both pared down our wardrobes pretty significantly.  I've
found that it's always difficult to get rid of stuff initially, but once it's
gone it feels great and it really is like a load off of your sholders.

Though I'm not sure how Belle and Zeus felt about all this...

We downgraded to the 10' UHaul truck (originally ordered the 14'), and I think
everything should fit just fine.

It's strange to see all of your belongings at one time in the same small space,
but at the same time it's refreshing to see the empty space in the rest of the
apartment.
