After an incredible wedding, we arise at 4am to catch our early flight back to
Washington DC.  We are exhausted, but we have some time to head back to the
apartment, get our stuff together, and have a little downtime before heading
to Dulles to start the honeymoon.

Before long, we're on a brightly-colored Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna.
The flight wasn't too bad, and I know I (Will) mostly slept the whole time.

The Vienna airport is not that fun of a place.  It seems like they are trying
to revamp it to be more modern, but in the meantime navigating the terminals
involves lots of stairs, narrow hallways that seem to lead you in circles, and
incredibly small terminals with not a lot of seating.

We had a 2-hour layover, so we found some food and found a place (not at our
terminal) to settle down for a bit.  Angelle watched some Star-Trek episodes on
her Macbook, while I got on the free wifi for a little bit.

Finally we got on our short flight to Dubrovnik.  This was our first (but
unfortunately not the last) experience on the wonderful (sarcasm) Croatian
Airlines.

Upon checking into the very nice Hilton Imperial, Dubrovnik, we were greeted to
this setup in our room!  Pretty awesome, and made us feel good after an
incrediblyl long, sleep-deprived day of travelling.

We plopped our things into the room, and took a much-needed nap.  We could
already tell it was very hot out, so why not wait until later in the afternoon
to go check out the city?

Getting a little hungry, we woke up just in time to go seek out dinner.  We
headed for the old town (just 1 block from the hotel) and walked down the main
street to see what we could find.  The views and lighting in the afternoon were
wonderful, and we could already tell we were going to like Dubrovnik.

It seems that every time we travel to Europe, the Euro Cup is going on, and we
quickly realized that this trip would be no exception.  As we looked for a good
place to eat, we began to see the TV's coming out into the streets, and people
hanging flags on the walls and sporting red and white striped jerseys.  We made
it out just in time for the Croatia-Spain game (it seems Croatia didn't have
much of a shot).

We finally decided to try out the Bistro Teatar at the end of the main street
for dinner.  For our first dinner out in Croatia we figured we'd go all out, so
we went with some fresh-caught fish, and a sampler of white and red local
Croatian wines.  Everything was delicious!

We are enjoying Croatia so far!
