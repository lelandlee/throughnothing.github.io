[Get your loved ones off Facebook](http://www.salimvirani.com/facebook/).

This is a really well-written piece on the endless privacy concerns with Facebook.  I’d recommend anyone using Facebook take a look.I’ve deleted my Facebook account in the past, but currently use it mostly for work groups.  I rarely make my own posts, and turn off Facebook chat on all my devices.  If someone messages me on Facebook Chat, I try to move the conversation out of there as quickly as possible.  Location services have also been disallowed on all my devices for Facebook, but this article inspired me to delete the Facebook app from my phone again.  I hardly use it there anyway.  Goodbye Facebook app.  We’ll see how long it lasts this time :)
