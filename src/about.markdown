# About Me
- - -

Hi there. I'm William Wolf, a software developer living in San Francisco. I love to read, travel,
think, create, build things, take pictures, and enjoy time with friends and family.

Some of my favorite things to think about are technology, business,
economics, investing, philosophy, photography, music, and health/fitness.

I currently work as a Payments Engineering Manager at [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com).
