Before March of this year I was not a runner. I couldn't tell you the last time I had run (for fun anyway). If you had told me then that I would be in love with running in just a few short months (or even sooner), I certainly would have laughed.

How fast things change.

As I write this today, not only am I in love with running, but in October I finished my first marathon -- and I'm looking forward to running more! I didn't run just any marathon, either -- I ran THE marathon.

So how did I go from docile couch potato (not entirely true) to marathon finisher in 8 short months? The real secret is just learning how to be a kid again. Another important thing for me was to NOT push myself (but as you'll see, this goes hand in hand with being a kid again).

So, to get started with your running career all you need is a good pair or running...shorts. Okay, okay, they don't even have to be running shorts. Grab any old shorts you have lying around and you're good to go. Ladies, you can pick out a shirt or sports top, too. Okay, got your shorts? Great, now let's get started!

What about the shoes?!

Ah, I'm glad you asked. Very early in my quest to begin running, I figured I should get a great pair of running shoes. I started off (miserably, I might add) just using some old tennis/running shoes that I had in the closet until I could do some research and get a good pair for me. I plodded around a mile or two here and there with those shoes and just kept wondering how I'd ever make it to 26 miles. I wasn't enjoying this at all, and was constantly having to push myself just to get this miles in (remember how I said a key thing for me was to not push myself?)

It didn't take much researching before I found that large groups of people were running without shoes! Not only were they not wearing shoes, but they were running injury-free, and loving it!

I did try to look into "proper" running shoes, but the whole process was so complex and riddled with ridiculous terms and measurements. Do I over pronate? Do I under pronate? What kind of arch do I have? The answer the these questions and more are supposed to determine the type of shoe that is "right" for your foot.

Of course, being the minimalist that I am, I generally seek out the simplest solutions. I figured "what the heck," and decided to just take my shoes off and give barefoot running a shot. This wouldn't cost me anything, and if it doesn't work out, I can always drop a small fortune on "real" running shoes later.

I started off very slow -- the trick is letting your feet and body tell you when you've had enough (see, this goes along with NOT pushing yourself, again).

WOW!

This is where learning to be a kid again comes in. Running barefoot really connects you to the earth and to your own body. Its like taking the earmuffs off your feet. The sounds of the world that you haven't heard since childhood rush back through your body. You're a child on the playground, and it is wonderful!

Take your time.

It can be a little overwhelming at first. If you've had the earmuffs on for too long, your body won't be used to all this extra sensory input. Thus, you need to take it slow and give your body time to adjust. Sometimes this can be hard. You may have so much fun that you want to keep going, or run more than you should -- I know I wanted to. Unfortunately, I did run more than I should have early on, and it resulted in some setbacks. Luckily I learned from my mistakes, and now hopefully you can too. Advance slowly.

Start slower than you think you should. It has probably been many years since you have run around barefoot, so many of the muscles in your bones and feet have probably atrophied and aren't ready to handle the stresses that they could if they had been in use for most of your life (like they should have been).

No Turning Back

If you're like me, you're going to absolutely love running this way, and you won't even want to put your "normal" running shoes back on (I never did -- they quickly found their way to the nearest Goodwill).    You may not even want to wear cushy, arch-supportive, raised-heeled shoes for daily walking around (I know I can't stand them anymore).  When I attended a wedding a few months into my barefoot running, I had to dig out my old dress shoes with a substantial heel on them.  My knees and feet were killing me the whole time.  Needless to say, those shoes will soon find a new home as well.

For longer distance runs, rougher terrain, and even for day-to-day walking around, you may eventually find that you want some protection for your feet (but not all the arch support, cushion, and raised heel that we're told we "need"). This is where "minimalist shoes" come in.

If you haven't heard of them, probably the most popular minimalist shoe these days are the Vibram Five Fingers. I ran barefoot (exclusively) for a few months before actually getting a pair, but ultimately I realized I would need them to begin doing runs longer than 8 miles or so (though now I would say this is entirely untrue -- I just needed to take my own advice and take my time; advance more slowly).  Now, however, they are pretty much my go-to every day shoes.  I no longer own a pair of shoes with arch support, cushioning, or a raised heel...my feet just despise them!

For the ultra-minimalists out there, you certainly don't need a pair of minimalist shoes. All you need are your bare feet with over a million years of biological engineering and natural selection baked right in. In fact, your bare feet are probably the most technologically advanced footwear money can't buy! To paraphrase Barefoot Ted:

    "I love technology. That's why I love my feet. What other shoe has millions of nerve endings that are wired straight into the worlds fastest computer (your brain), allowing you to feel the ground and make millions of tiny adjustments subconsciously in fractions of a second."

Your body, feet, and mind are beautiful things. Modern technology (if you can call 30 years of Nike foam "technology") can't even begin to compete with the millions of years of evolutionary biology that we all born with. The modern running shoe is based on the false assumption that our bodies are somehow broken when, in fact, they are not. Embrace the history of the human race, the amazing agility and functionality of your body, and make yourself healthier and happier along the way!

Upping Your Mileage

The best way to up your mileage is to just run at your own pace, and run for as long as you feel comfortable.  No more, no less.  During my training, I did have a deadline  and a goal(I had 8 months to go from 0 to 26.2!), but I think avoiding deadlines and structured running programs is hands down the best way to go if you can do this.  I never followed any sort of structured program, though I did read about some online.  None of them seemed to fit what I was trying to do.  I didn't want to have a schedule, an feel forced to run x miles for x days, etc.

If your goal is to run a marathon, run as often as you feel like, and stop when your body tells you to.  If you find that you aren't loving it anymore, take a break and figure out why.  Don't run when you aren't enjoying it. If you are enjoying your running, your mileage will increase all by itself.  Chris Hawson, a foot-model in New York, and (strangely enough) avid barefoot runner, epitomizes this idea.  In his interview with John Durant, he says:

    I heard you ran an "accidental" marathon recently.

    In the cooler weather this autumn I amazed myself a couple of weeks ago when I ran 29 barefoot miles without any problem and felt far less tired at the end of that than I had running shorter distances, in shoes, last year.

    You just went out and ran 29 miles?

    Yeah.

This was pretty much my experience when I ran the longest run of my entire life --  I wasn't even trying to!

One Saturday morning I was planning on trying for a longer run than I had been doing (7-10 miles), but I wasn't going to push myself.  I planned to just go out, run, and see how I felt (just like I always do, really).  About 18 miles later I was about ready to stop.  I did have to push myself a little bit to make it the last 3 miles back to my apartment, but it was a fantastic run.  I felt so good afterwards.  My feet had no blisters, they felt stronger than ever, and at that moment I knew I was ready for the marathon.

Be Patient

Be patient with your running.  Let your natural form fall into place.  Remember to always have fun and enjoy what you're doing.  After all, that is the point.  If you aren't enjoying your running, then you don't want to run a miserable marathon anyway.  Figure out what to adjust and change to make you truly love it.  Then, when you're out there on the road you'll find your flow, your mind will clear, and the rest will come naturally.

Finishing the Marathon

On October 31, 2010 I completed my first marathon, just 8 short months after I set out to do so.  This year's Athens Classic Marathon was the 2,500th anniversary of the original marathon course run by Pheidippides to announce the Greek Victory over Persia in the Battle of Marathon to the Athenians.  The legend has it that upon arriving in Athens and delivering the good news, Pheidippides dropped dead of exhaustion from his run.  Luckily I did not share Pheidippides' fate this year, but finished the marathon strong and with juice left in my tank.  I ran the race in my Vibram Five Finger Sprints, and plan on running my next marathon completely barefoot.  F inishing a marathon is an exhilarating experience that I hope

Links

In my brief time running barefoot (and loving the crap out of it), I have come across many invaluable web resources that you might find useful.  I'm still a beginner in the field of barefoot running compared to many people such as Barefoot Ken Bob, who have been doing it for decades, but hopefully my article, and these links can help you to get started and find joy an happiness in your running.

    Barefoot Ted - One of the leaders of the barefoot movement thanks to "Born To Run" and Christopher McDougal. He is starting his own running sandal company (Luna Sandals), and has a very useful discussion group on his site.
    Running Barefoot - Barefoot Ken Bob's (the original barefoot runner) site is a wealth of information on barefoot running!
    Birthday Shoes - The unofficial fan site of vibram five fingers and other minimalist shoes.  Full of great reviews, tips, and user stories.
    Chris Mcdougal - Author of the great book, "Born to Run."  He found barefoot running by accident (just like many of us, I believe) and tells the thrilling story of his experiences in Mexico with the Tarahumara Indians.
