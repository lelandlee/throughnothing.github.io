        <p>Structured processes are incredibly useful, and often necessary,
beasts.  They are, however, almost never the <em>most</em> important things for a
project.  We shouldn&#39;t hold on to and adhere to processes just because.
Processes are in place to ensure the quality and timeliness of our work.
When they cease to work towards this end, its <em>ok</em> to break the mold.
Live a little sometimes: let go, buck the man, don&#39;t mark that jira ticket
<code>closed</code> even though it&#39;s been deployed, it&#39;ll be ok, I promise.  Say &#39;no&#39; to a
meeting when you&#39;re in the zone getting-shit-done™, tackle a ticket that isn&#39;t
assigned to you, or even <em>gasp</em> fix a bug that hasn&#39;t even been filed yet.</p>

        </span>
        
    </p>

    <div class="body">
        <p>For a while now, I&#39;ve been wanting to add some sort of maps support to
<a href="http://octopress.org/">octopress</a>/<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a>,
and I finally recently had some time to look into it a little bit more.
It seems some others out there have had the same idea, because I stumbled
across two plugins that did something close (but not exactly) to what I wanted:
<a href="https://github.com/mguentner/octolayer">octolayer</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/matthewowen/jekyll-mapping">jekyll-mapping</a>.</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m interested in this is that when I travel, I like to log <code>gpx</code>
tracks of the places we go, and geotag my photos, etc.  It&#39;s nice to be able to
display a map of where I went each day, and I can always go back and find
exactly where that awesome restaurant was (in case I go back, or to tell
friends).</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t really sure how/if jekyll plugins would map to octopress (since
octopress does use jekyll, but its plugin structure still seems to be slightly
different), so I started off looking into octolayer.</p>

<h2>Octolayer</h2>

<p>Octolayer was only setup to use <a href="http://openlayers.org/">openlayers</a>, and it
could only do specific long/lat co-ordinates.  I really wanted to be able to use
google maps, but I figured i&#39;d give this a try and see how things went.</p>

<p>I liked the way that octolayer was set up, and the ease of installing it, but
the openlayers API looked really messy to me, and I didn&#39;t feel like spending a
bunch of time learning it when I really wanted google maps anyway, so I opened
up an <a href="https://github.com/matthewowen/jekyll-mapping/issues/1">issue</a> with
<a href="https://github.com/matthewowen/">matthewowen</a> to see what his
thoughts were about adding the functionality I wanted to <code>jekyll-mapping</code>.</p>

<h2>Jekyll-Mapping</h2>

<p>Matthew responded pretty quickly, and showed me that he really already had basic
support for what I wanted.  Fantastic.  All you had to do was put this in your
config section of your posts:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">mapping:
    layers:
        - http://path/to/kml_file.kml
        - http://path/to/gpx_file.gpx
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then put this in your post body wherever you want the map to render:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">{% render_map %}
</code></pre></div>
<p>That&#39;s it!  It seemed to work pretty well at first, but then I quickly realized
that the way the code was set up, it would only work on the post page, and would
not be able to display multiple maps on a page that lists several posts (or even
one post with multiple maps).  The javascript used an id to find the
<code>jekyll-mapping</code> element, and it was tightly bound to a single-post page.</p>

<p>I decided to head into <code>#octopress</code> and ask around (I&#39;ve never mucked with
octopress source or plugins before), and got some really useful tips and help
from <a href="https://github.com/imathis">Brandon Mathis</a>, Octopress&#39; creator.</p>

<p>After a bit of tinkering, I ended up with
<a href="https://github.com/throughnothing/jekyll-mapping/compare/refactor">this changeset</a>
that gave me pretty much everything I wanted (for now):</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3183238.js"> </script>

<p>With this, I can put multiple layers on a map (I usually put a <code>.gpx</code> layer for
the day, as well as a layer from flickr with my geotagged photoset for that day
in each relevant post), and display multiple posts, each with a map, per page.</p>

    economics,

    poverty


        </span>
        
    </p>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The economist recently ran an article titled <a href="http://%20www.economist.com/node/21548963/">For the first time ever,the number of poor people is declining everywhere</a>.
That&#39;s a pretty amazing statistic if it&#39;s true, so I couldn&#39;t help but check
it out.</p>

<p>The article starts out by telling us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best estimates for global poverty come from the World Bank’s Development
Research Group, which has just updated from 2005 its figures for those
living in absolute poverty (not be confused with the relative measure
commonly used in rich countries). The new estimates show that in 2008, the
first year of the finance-and-food crisis, both the number and share of the
population living on less than $1.25 a day (at 2005 prices, the most
commonly accepted poverty line) was falling in every part of the world. This
was the first instance of declines across the board since the bank started
collecting the figures in 1981 (see chart).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right off the bat I&#39;m a little skeptical that <strong>the best</strong> estimates for
global poverty from anywhere in the world come from...a bank -- much less the
almighty World Bank.  But that&#39;s just me, let&#39;s dig into the actual numbers.</p>

<p>The research from the World Bank defines a person in poverty as one who lives on
less than $1.25 a day, and these dollars are fixed at 2005 dollar values.  So
their data tells us that, when adjusted for inflation, there are a smaller
percentage of people today living on less than $1.25 a day, than there have
been since 1981.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what the dollar has done since 1981. I found this
interesting chart from the Federal Reserve:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/dolllarindex.png" title="&#34;US Dollar Index&#34;" alt="&#34;US Dollar Index&#34;"></p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it rather interesting that the dollar index is virtually at the lowest
point it has been at since records began (even before 1981)?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a big believer that hard assets have more stable value over time than
fiat, government-printed paper, which means they are a better measure of
value over time -- a better yardstick, so to speak -- so I also looked up a chart from
<a href="http://pricedingold.com">princedingold</a> comparing US dollars with the price
of gold since the late 18th century (the relatively straight lines in the
beginning are due to the fact that the dollar was linked to gold up until 1971):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/USD-1787-log.png" title="&#34;US Dollar Vs. Gold&#34;" alt="&#34;US Dollar Vs. Gold&#34;"></p>

<p>Again, we see that the US Dollar vs Gold is at an all time low.  What this
tells us is that, nominally, the value of the US dollar is the lowest it has
been ever.  This means that someone living off of $1.25 in 1981 was doing
much better off than someone living off of $1.25 today.  Based off the first
chart above, let&#39;s say the dollar index was around 100 in 1981, and that it
stands right around 70 today.  That means that today, you would have to live
on $1.79 just to have the same standard of living you had in 1981 with $1.25.
If you use the gold values from the second chart it&#39;s even worse.  Based on that
measurement you&#39;d have to live on closer to $3 a day today to have the same
standard of living you had in 1981 -- nearly 300% more!</p>

<p>These examples are all nominal, of course, and the World Bank tells us that they
are adjusting everything to 2005 dollars (what they did before 2005 I have no
idea).  I don&#39;t know exactly how they are doing this adjustment, but I would
guess they are using something like the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cpi/">CPI</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the CPI doesn&#39;t make for that good of a yardstick either.  It has been
changed many times over the years, and during the recent housing boom,
the CPI didn&#39;t even include house prices!  Right now the CPI doesn&#39;t include
food or gas prices, the two things whose price is increasing the most!  So how
accurate can the CPI really be, and how accurate can adjustments made off of it
(or any similar measure) really be compared to real value.  For those
interested, <a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/">Doug Short</a> has some great
alternative inflation measurements and
<a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Inflation-Since-1872.php">writeups</a>
that are worth a look.</p>

<p>My point here isn&#39;t really to prove their numbers wrong, but just to point out
a few of the many problems with data such as this.  Measuring poverty by those
living on X oz. of gold would have it&#39;s problems as well, so there is no perfect
solution.  But if we did use the gold measurement, and adjust based on that,
I&#39;d bet that the conclusion is probably <em>very</em> different.</p>

<p>Look, we all want poverty to go down, but the World Bank in particular has
an interest in making sure countries the world over want to take more of
their strings-attached loans to &#39;better their countries&#39;.  We&#39;ve seen how the
banks act in the United States, does anyone think they act in the interest of
the poor?</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that global poverty is likely on the decline, especially
over the long run.  I believe there are many today worse off than they were
last year, the year before, or even in 1981, but in aggregate, I think it&#39;s
likely that the global standard of living is increasing.  We are a resilient,
resourceful, and creative species, and we continue to progress and better our
standard of living.</p>

<p>The sensational title from the Economist states &quot;For the first time ever...&quot;
Really?  Since the dawn of the first humans on this earth, this is the first
time global poverty has ever declined?  I think someone was fishing for readers,
and hey, they got this reader to bite.  But let&#39;s take their data with a huge
grain of salt.</p>

    <div class="body">
        <p>It&#39;s been about 5 months since I quit my day job and decided to plunge
head-first into the world of <a href="https://www.crowdtilt.com">startups</a>.
It&#39;s been an amazing ride so far, and I know I&#39;ve only begun to scratch
the surface of what&#39;s to come.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve been incredibly fortunate to have some
<a href="https://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/webmailus_acquired_by_rackspace.php">great</a>
<a href="http://www.siteworx.com">jobs</a> with some incredibly
intelligent and talented people.  I&#39;ve learned
a lot along the way, and the experiences have been great.  The breakneck
pace of the past 5 months at <a href="https://www.crowdtilt.com">crowdtilt</a>, however,
is something I hadn&#39;t experienced before.  It&#39;s amazing how fast
perspectives can change.</p>

<p>With a small team (we&#39;ve currently got 2 developers) everyone has lots
of autonomy, responsibility, and most importantly (for me, at least)
each person has the ability to have a <strong>huge</strong> impact on the business (and
on people&#39;s lives).  Every person on the team is empowered to make decisions,
move as quickly as possible, and really own the things they do.  This is often
lost at larger corporations, where there&#39;s more beauracracy and processes to
get in the way of what us developers really want to be doing (coding and
getting things done &trade;).  In this environment abstract teams own things,
while people and individuality are lost.  Thus far I&#39;ve been really happy with
our focus, our pace, and our ability to keep tedious processes and long
decision-chains to a bare minimum.</p>

<p>Ownership and impact are two things that I think are really big in a startup
environment -- in fact, they&#39;re huge.  To really own the tasks at hand while 
taking on the responsibility of getting them done and making the hundreds of
small decisions that inevitably come with any project is really rewarding
and also satisfying.  When you are given the power to make these decisions
it helps the company move faster, which is very exciting, but it also adds
creativity and brainpower to the companies growth engine -- after all,
startups don&#39;t just want instruction-followers, they want creators and doers.</p>

<p>As we look to grow our team, we&#39;re going to put a lot of focus on keeping these
things in tact.  We want to make sure everyone is empowered, self-motivated and
has access to all the tools they need to do great work.  We want to find
people who have a passion for creating great things, thrive with autonomy, and
want the opportunity to have a very large impact every single day.</p>
