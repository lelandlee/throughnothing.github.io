Our dog, Belle, has recently been running into some health issues that we’ve been dealing with.  The little fur-ball of joy has been with us for over 7 years now, and has become an integral part of our family.  It’s so easy to grow accustomed to these seemingly stable things in our lives and take them for granted.  But we forget that everything changes; nothing is permanent.  All the things around us, and all that we know, will come to an end. This may sound somber, but it can be very motivating and is something we have no choice but to embrace.There’s no better catalyst to help us live in this one fleeting moment that we have, than the realization that our time is incredibly limited.Ironically, I sometimes find myself jealous of Belle.  She seems all but incapable of living anywhere but the here and now.  While we go through the process of finding out what’s wrong, and what we can do to help her, she remains unfazed and unworried.  When there’s something new, she’s nervous.  When there’s a bone, she chews it with vigor.  When its bed time, she still tries to take up half the bed :P  We’re the ones doing all the worrying: thinking about the past and worrying about the uncertain future.  It’s hard to stay grounded in now.Belle is still doing alright, and we’ve still got some more tests to run before we know bad things are and if the issues are ‘solvable’.  She’s happy, home, and lounging around like her normal self.I think she’ll be just fine, and we’ll have her around for a bit longer, but I’m glad for the reminder that nothing is permanent.  We will try our best to enjoy the moments we have…after all, that’s all we’ve got.
