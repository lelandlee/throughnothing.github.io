Updating my layout for 2014, and switching back to plain
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), away from
[Octopress](http://octopress.org).  Octopress was a little too complicated,
did a little too much magic, was confusing/difficult to re-style,
and was much too difficult to maintain/keep up-to-date.

I'm liking plain old [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) +
[Bootstrap](htpp://getbootstrap.com) much better, and it actually reduces the
friction to making new posts. So, with that, hopefully I'll be able to push some
of my thoughts here more frequently this year.
