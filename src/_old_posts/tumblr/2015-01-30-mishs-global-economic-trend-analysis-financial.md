Mish''s Global Economic Trend Analysis: Financial Blogger Profile of "Mish" on Equities.ComThis stuck out to me:I like Japanese equities, but hedged for a plunge in the yen. I think that trade has tremendous potential. Unlike the US, there’s a very decent chance that Japan goes into hyperinflation. If that happens, that long Japanese equities but short the yen could literally be the trade of the century. Whether it plays out that way or not, and what timeframe, I don’t know. It all depends on how insane Abenomics in Japan gets.I also liked this:When Jim Grant was once asked ‘how should one value gold?’, he proposed that the value of gold probably is ''1/N’, with ''N’ standing for the faith people have in the monetary authority. The more this faith declines, the higher the price of gold will go.
