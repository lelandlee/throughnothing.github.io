Today is the day we start the long trek across the country.  We've been
[preparing and  packing](/2012-07-26-getting-ready-for-the-cross-country-road-trip.markdown) for a few days, and pretty much
have all of our stuff in boxes.  The emptiness of the house feels very
awkward, but also calming and peaceful.  We have a lot to do today. Angelle has
a normal work day, and I have to get some work done in the morning, then turn in
our comcast stuff (bye bye internet after that), then pack all of our worldy
posessions into a small 10 foot truck.  Zeus doesn't seem to be bothered by
this.

After dropping off the Comcast stuff around 1pm with no hassle, I went to try
and pick up the U-Haul early.  Luckily it was available early, but the trailer
(for Angelle's car) wouldn't be ready until around 4pm, so I got the truck and
headed home to load it as quickly as I could.

## Loading the Truck

For efficiency of loading, I locked Belle and Zeus in the bedroom (all of our
stuff was in boxes in the living room) so that I could leave the apartment door
and building front doors open and load boxes up as quickly as possible.

Figuring out how to place stuff in the truck is always the hardest part.  You
want to make sure everything fits, but you don't want there to be too much
(floor) space at the end so that there's not a lot of room for stuff to move.  I
generally start by packing things really high in the back, and then as I get
towards the end, I can pull stuff from up high to put on the floor and make
lower stacks as I see how things are coming and how much space our stuff will
take up.

This method seemed to work pretty well.  I'm not sure if I packed some of our
more fragile items in the best way, but we'll see how it holds up!  I stacked
the chairs on top of each other for the most part where I could, put the desk
and kitchen table upside down with boxes on top, and tried to keep heavier stuff
towards the bottom of stacks.  Last in was the bikes, which just barely fit at
the very back.  Everything seemed pretty snug, so hopefully we won't have much
stuff moving around during the drive.

Loading up the truck around 2pm made for a very hot, sweaty, workout, but once
I was done, I got some cold water (luckily we still had some
(probably very old) ice in the freezer), played with Belle and Zeus for a few
minutes (in a completely empty house), and then headed back to U-Haul to pick up
the trailer and load up our car.

Hooking up the trailer and getting the car onto it wasn't as hard as I thought
it'd be.  In no time I was driving back home with the fully loaded truck,
trailer with car in tow.  The drive of the truck was *significantly* different
with the trailer.  Much more drag, much more strain on the engine, wider
turns, and lots more checking the side-view mirrors to make sure the trailer was
in the lines.

What I was worried about was where I was gonna park this thing to pick up
Angelle, Belle and Zeus at the apartment.  Luckily there were a bunch of open
meters across the street with just enough room for me to pull into.  Even though
the USPS guy was yelling at me and telling me I couldn't park there (in front of
his store), we managed anyway.  Angelle brought Belle out, but I had to run in
and force Zeus into his cage (he did __not__ want to get in), and then we were
on our way to I-66W.

# Starting the Drive

Our goal was to get to Bristol tonight (a 7 hour drive), but we were starting
a lot later than planned (around 5:30pm), so we figured we'd just see how far we
can get -- I was exhausted from loading up the truck, and Angelle was pretty
exhausted from a long day at work.

We ended up making it just fine and just on schedule.  Looks like we're starting
off the trip on a good note!  Hopefully less junk food can be involved in future
days :)
