I don’t know.  And neither does anybody else.  But I do know that the 10-year trailing price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) for the S&P is still 46.1% above the historical mean of 16.7 (see more here).  This is generally a pretty good metric of market valuations, though not necessarily the best.According to Warren Buffett’s favorite indicator, Market Cap to GDP, the Market is “modestly” overvalued.  Note that recent GDP quarters have been getting revised downward, which could push this metric into “significantly overvalued” territory pretty easily.  It’s actually only a few percentage points from that status.At current valuations, both of these metrics would estimate stocks to earn 1-2% over the coming decade.  That’s right, only 1-2% annual returns for the coming decade.  That, in spite of the fact that current dividend yields hover around 2.2%!What would the level of the market (here I’ll use the S&P 500) need to be, at present, to be able to expect historically “normal” market returns of 8-10%?  This would require something near ‘mean’ valuations.  Based on todays earnings (which are very likely extremely extended), the S&P 500 would need to trade at around $1060, to have a ‘mean’ P/E ratio of 16.7.  Don’t forget that it *actually* trades at around $1870 as I write this.  It requires a $1060 price, to reasonably expect ‘normal’ returns.  That’s not even an under-valued state.  The market would need to fall even farther to provide under-valued deals.  Of course, if these extended earnings retreat, the market will need to fall even farther just to mean-revert.I don’t know if the market bottom is in, but I’m certainly not betting on it.
