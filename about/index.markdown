Hi there.  I'm William Wolf, a software developer living in San Francisco.
I love to read, think, and create.  Some of my favorite things to
think about are Bitcoin/crypto-currency, philosophy, technology, business,
economics, and health/fitness.

I currently work as the Director of Technology for [Tilt](https://www.tilt.com).
