Hi there.  I'm William Wolf, a software developer living in San Francisco.
I love to read, think, and create.  Some of my favorite things to
think about are philosophy, technology, business, economics, and health/fitness.

I currently work as the director of engineering for
[Crowdtilt](https://www.crowdtilt.com).
