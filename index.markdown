#Hi, I'm William Wolf


I love to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7295031-will).  
I sometimes [think in public](http://blog.throughnothing.com).  
You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/throughnothing).  
And on  [instagram](https://instagram.com/throughnothing).  
I write code on [GitHub](https://github.com/throughnothing).  


I'm a geek that loves technology, philosophy, economics, Éƒitcoin, health,
and generally all things voluntary. By day, I'm the Directory of
Technology at [Tilt](https://www.tilt.com).
