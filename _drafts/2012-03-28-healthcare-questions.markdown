* Is healthcare a basic human right?

* What defines a basic human right?

* Can the attainment of a basic human right necessitate the violation of a basic
  human right of someone else?

* Does every human have a basic human right to his or her life, and the
  goods/services produced by that life?

* Is healthcare a good/service that must be produced?

* Can someone have a right to a good/service produced by another human
  without violating the basic human right of that person to own and control the
  goods/services they produce?
