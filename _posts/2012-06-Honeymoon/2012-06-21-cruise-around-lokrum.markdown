We had no real agenda for today.  It was sort of an off-day between our Mostar
trip and our 3-island cruise tomorrow.  So we started off with our usual
late-start, but were woken up early (10am-ish) by the maid who kept knocking and
knocking even after we told her to leave.

Finally we went to go see what she wanted, and were presented with an awesome
gift tray of fruit and champagne from some of Angelle's co-workers.

We snacked on the fruit for a little bit, and then headed for the old town.  It
was another incredibly hot day, so we tried to stay in the shad as much as we
could.  After reaching the other side of the old town, we decided to get lunch
at a place right on the old harbor.  Angelle decided to go with pizza again
(imagine that!) but this time it wasn't as good as before :(

After 'lunch' we walked around and tried to think of ways to avoid the heat of
the middle of the day.  We noticed they had short 45 minute glass-bottom boat
cruises around Lokrum and they weren't very expensive (and covered) so we
decided to give that a try.  We caught one just as it was about to leave.

The cruise was a good, lazy, refresher to get us through the hottest part of the
day.  On the way back in, we noticed a lot of people swimming at the end of the
pier in the old town, so we decided we'd go back to the hotel, get our bathing
suits on, and check out the hot swim spot.

We even met a newly-engaged couple from Florida, Andy and Laura (?).

When the sun set a little bit more, it was time to explore the side streets and
back alleys of the old town.  We hadn't walked back there much and had been
wanting to check it out.  Also, on the boat cruise, we noticed there was a
restaurant or two along the outer wall of the fort, and we wanted to find those.

We finally found one of the 'restaurants' only to find out that it was just a
bar, no food.

By this point we had worked up a pretty good apetite, so we headed back to
the main strip to get some food.

Our waiter's birthday was in 6 days (he was turning 22), and he spoke Croatian,
English, Italian and Spanish....at least that we knew about.  Crazy!
