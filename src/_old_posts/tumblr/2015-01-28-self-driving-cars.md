It seems almost every day there is a new article about  self-driving cars.Some have posited that self-driving cars may kill ride-sharing companies, or at least harm their business model.  I might argue that ride-sharing companies will be some of the first to take advantage of this technology, at least in the consumer space.  Uber may be in the best position of anyone to take advantage of the self-driving car.  Why?Google is one of the biggest investors in Uber.Google is at the forefront of self-driving car technology.If and when Google’s technology is ready (technologically, and legally) for Taxi/Uber rides, who would Google let use their technology?  Lfyt?  Sidecar? Taxis?  How about the company they have a large equity stake in, and the most to gain from?So, when will we be getting much cheaper rides in a self-driving car?  I don’t know, but it seems inevitable that we will.  And it will continue to drive down the costs for everyone.
