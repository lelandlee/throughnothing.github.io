Above you can see everything I'm bringing with me for 2.5 weeks in India.
Clicking the image will bring you to the flickr page with a description of
what each item is.  I'm trying to pack as light as I can, while still bringing
my DSLR + Lenses, and my laptop to get work done.  There are certainly a few
items I could get rid of from here, such as the nook, the GPS
(and thus the battery charger and AA batteries), but I have plenty of room
in my backpack still, so I can handle the extra bulk.

My Camera, charger, and lenses will actually fit in the Targus pack as well,
but it makes it a little bit too full, and I want to have the Tamrac
camera bag (upper left) as a day pack anyway.

Because it will be warm while I'm there, I can get by with just sandals,
and lightweight, breathable clothing.  No need for jackets.  I plan on washing
my clothes every few days either in the sink or in the aLokSak bag.  Below
I've listed everything you see in the photo.

So that is what I'm bringing.  I'll post my thoughts during and after the
trip about things I may have forgotten to bring, or things that I brought
and didn't need.  Hopefully I'll have everything that I need and nothing that
I don't.
