<p>Today my company, <a href="http://www.siteworx.com">Siteworx</a>, was one of the sponsors of the <a href="http://main.diabetes.org/site/TR/StepOut/DistrictofColumbiaMetroArea?pg=entry&amp;fr_id=7239">Steppin&#8217; Out for Diabetes</a> walk/run in Washington D.C.  The course starts and ends by the Nationals stadium in southern D.C.</p>
<p>We got there pretty early, before many other people were there.  At least parking was easy!  Plus we had to support our Siteworx crew that was out there even earlier than us setting up the nice booth :)</p>

<p>It was a pretty chilly morning, we all wore vibrams to the event to keep our feet warm, but Andy and I were planning on shedding the vibrams for the run.</p>

<p>After walking around for a bit and checking out all that there was to see (not much, except for a pretty good dance group doing some cool stuff), it was time to shed the shoes!</p>

After some waiting around, the &#8220;race&#8221; was off to a&#8230;.slow start.  We initially had to weave through the hundreds of walkers until we got out of the stadium and into the streets where there was more room to get out in front of all the walkers.  Once we got to that point it was smooth sailing&#8230;.almost.</p>
<p><a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1329/5109108626_8221b2055c_z.jpg"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1329/5109108626_8221b2055c_z.jpg" title="Andy and Kevin Running on the DC Streets" alt="Andy and Kevin Running on the DC Streets" /></a></p>
<p>The main complaint I have is that the course was very poorly marked in many locations, and it seemed other runners and walkers were having difficulty following and seeing the signs as well.  I&#8217;m still not sure if we did the entire course correctly (we definitely made a few wrong turns and had to loop back), but according to my iPhone we only ended up running 4 miles, not the complete 5. But at least we made it to the finish, and we were feeling great.</p>

    </p>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Lately I&#8217;ve been wanting to do more writing.  I want to jot down my thoughts more often, and hopefully get better at both writing them down, and using writing as a way to organize and record my thoughts.  I&#8217;ve almost always used vim as my text editor, development platform, and just about everything else you can imagine, but lately i&#8217;ve been looking for something that might help me avoid the distractions of being in a terminal, and having multiple windows visible behind what i&#8217;m working on (usually browsers) etc.</p>
<p>So in looking for some good minimal text editors, I came across two that I am going to be trying out.  The first, and probably more minimal of the two is <a href="http://pyroom.org">PyRoom</a>.  PyRoom is written in python and basically takes up your entire screen, with the middle section (height/width is adjustable) used for simple, plain text.  It doesn&#8217;t have the power of vim in terms of keyboard shortcuts, but it does basic editing, and allows multiple buffers.  It does have a few keyboard shortcuts for closing buffers, switching buffers, etc., which is nice, but I want my insert/normal modes!  As I said, PyRoom is very minimal, with no menus or anything except for one preferences dialog that you can get to with Ctrl+p.  The colors are customizable, as well as the height/width as I said before, but other than that there isn&#8217;t much to customize.</p>
<p>The other editor I will be trying out is <a href="http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/">FocusWriter</a>.  FocusWriter is actually cross-platform, so I can use it on my Mac at work if I so desire.  It has a lot more features, and is a lot less minimal than PyRoom &#8212; it does rich text editing, has menus, and even a hidden menu bar that can be pulled up.  When FocusWriter is run, the interface seems about the same as PyRoom, but by moving the mouse to the top, or bottom of the screen, you can show the menus, tab-bars, and toolbars that normally stay hidden from view.</p>
<p>One nice feature about FocusWriter that I like is that you can set a daily goal for writing, such as 30 minutes, or 1,000 words, etc.  This may be nice as I try to get myself to do more writing, so that I could set goals and try to force myself to actually just write every day, no matter how terrible it may be :P</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to try these two editors out for a while and see how it goes.  So far I&#8217;ve typed this whole post in PyRoom and like it.  It keeps the distractions at bay and lets me focus on my writing.  I feel like I may end up falling back to vim eventualy just because I love the power of vim for editing text, but it seems that these editors may provide a better level of focus that may be worth it.  We shall see.</p>

    <p class="meta text-muted">
        <span class="date">20 Oct 2010</span>

        
    </p>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Nina Paley recently <a href="http://questioncopyright.org/CC-branding-confusion">wrote about</a> some of the issues she has had releasing some of her work under a Creative Commons-Share Alike license, as well some of the confusion brought about by the various creative commons licenses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About a year and a half ago I released my film Sita Sings the Blues under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. That license allows truly free distribution, including commercial use, as long as the free license remains in place. But my experience is that most people see the words &#8220;Creative Commons&#8221; and simply assume the license is Non-Commercial &#8212; because the majority of Creative Commons licenses they&#8217;ve seen elsewhere have been Non-Commercial.</p>
<p>This is a real problem. Some artists have re-released Sita remixes under Creative Commons Non-Commercial licenses. Many bloggers and journalists assume the non-commercial restrictions, even when the license is correctly named:</p>
<p>The film was made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License, allowing third parties to share the creative content for non-commercial purposes freely as long as the author of the content is attributed as the creator of the work. &#8212;Frontline, India&#8217;s National Magazine</p>
<p>Initially I tried to explain what &#8220;ShareAlike&#8221; means, and asked &#8220;Sita&#8221; remixers to please switch to ShareAlike, per the terms of the ShareAlike license under which I released it. I felt like an ass; I don&#8217;t want to be a licensing cop. After a while, mis-identifications of the project&#8217;s license became so widespread I gave up trying to correct them. &#8220;Creative Commons&#8221; means &#8220;Non-Commercial&#8221; to most people. Fighting it is a sisyphean task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a lot of confusion around Creative Commons with many people assuming that it is <em>always</em> non-commercial, and others not understanding creative commons licenses at all.  The real tragedy is that Nina is trying to essentially have her work be open and available to anyone for any purpose, and people are still not understanding that.  Nina concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need a license that people understand. I&#8217;m tempted by the <span class="caps">WTFPL</span> but I would have to fork it to add a copyleft provision. The Do Whatever You Want And Don&#8217;t Restrict Others From Doing Whatever They Want Public License? <span class="caps">WTFDROPL</span>?</p>
<p>Are there any other useable Copyleft licenses out there that aren&#8217;t associated with non-commercial restrictions? I&#8217;m open to suggestions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is an interesting question.  Being one who is very interested in the topic, I am very aware of the differences between the various Creative Commons Licenses, and never really thought there would be such confusion, but obviously that was a wrong assumption.</p>
<p>In some searching for other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> licenses, I came across the <a href="http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en">Free Art License</a>, which may be of some use to Nina.</p>
<p>This brings up another interesting thought, however, and that is with regards to copyleft licenses versus public domain, or &#8220;uncopyright.&#8221;  You may have noticed that all the material on my site(s) is &#8220;uncopyrighted&#8221; and that I release all of the content into the public domain.  Reading this article did make me think again about copyleft vs. public domain, as copyleft has the restriction that anyone creating derivative works from the original work, is forced to release their derivative works under the same license without restrictions.  This seems like it may have the benefit that society as a whole is guaranteed to have access to share, use, and benefit from any derivative works in exactly the same way that it could from the original.  It does, however, impose the creator&#8217;s will onto others, and I still find this unnatural.  Copyleft essentially makes use of copyright to achieve its ends, but I&#8217;m still not sold that copyright is the way to go.  I will continue to release my content into the public domain, and use that as my &#8220;license&#8221; of choice wherever possible.</p>
<p>As another side note, when is <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> going to add a &#8220;public domain&#8221; option to their licensing options?  For now I am forced to chose Creative Commons-Share Alike, as that is the most liberal license (and a copyleft license), but I would prefer to be able to chose &#8220;public domain&#8221;.  Come on flickr, can&#8217;t we get that?!</p>
