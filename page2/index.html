    <div class="body">
        <p>For a while now, I&#39;ve been wanting to add some sort of maps support to
<a href="http://octopress.org/">octopress</a>/<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a>,
and I finally recently had some time to look into it a little bit more.
It seems some others out there have had the same idea, because I stumbled
across two plugins that did something close (but not exactly) to what I wanted:
<a href="https://github.com/mguentner/octolayer">octolayer</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/matthewowen/jekyll-mapping">jekyll-mapping</a>.</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m interested in this is that when I travel, I like to log <code>gpx</code>
tracks of the places we go, and geotag my photos, etc.  It&#39;s nice to be able to
display a map of where I went each day, and I can always go back and find
exactly where that awesome restaurant was (in case I go back, or to tell
friends).</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t really sure how/if jekyll plugins would map to octopress (since
octopress does use jekyll, but its plugin structure still seems to be slightly
different), so I started off looking into octolayer.</p>

<h2>Octolayer</h2>

<p>Octolayer was only setup to use <a href="http://openlayers.org/">openlayers</a>, and it
could only do specific long/lat co-ordinates.  I really wanted to be able to use
google maps, but I figured i&#39;d give this a try and see how things went.</p>

<p>I liked the way that octolayer was set up, and the ease of installing it, but
the openlayers API looked really messy to me, and I didn&#39;t feel like spending a
bunch of time learning it when I really wanted google maps anyway, so I opened
up an <a href="https://github.com/matthewowen/jekyll-mapping/issues/1">issue</a> with
<a href="https://github.com/matthewowen/">matthewowen</a> to see what his
thoughts were about adding the functionality I wanted to <code>jekyll-mapping</code>.</p>

<h2>Jekyll-Mapping</h2>

<p>Matthew responded pretty quickly, and showed me that he really already had basic
support for what I wanted.  Fantastic.  All you had to do was put this in your
config section of your posts:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">mapping:
    layers:
        - http://path/to/kml_file.kml
        - http://path/to/gpx_file.gpx
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then put this in your post body wherever you want the map to render:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">{% render_map %}
</code></pre></div>
<p>That&#39;s it!  It seemed to work pretty well at first, but then I quickly realized
that the way the code was set up, it would only work on the post page, and would
not be able to display multiple maps on a page that lists several posts (or even
one post with multiple maps).  The javascript used an id to find the
<code>jekyll-mapping</code> element, and it was tightly bound to a single-post page.</p>

<p>I decided to head into <code>#octopress</code> and ask around (I&#39;ve never mucked with
octopress source or plugins before), and got some really useful tips and help
from <a href="https://github.com/imathis">Brandon Mathis</a>, Octopress&#39; creator.</p>

<p>After a bit of tinkering, I ended up with
<a href="https://github.com/throughnothing/jekyll-mapping/compare/refactor">this changeset</a>
that gave me pretty much everything I wanted (for now):</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3183238.js"> </script>

<p>With this, I can put multiple layers on a map (I usually put a <code>.gpx</code> layer for
the day, as well as a layer from flickr with my geotagged photoset for that day
in each relevant post), and display multiple posts, each with a map, per page.</p>
