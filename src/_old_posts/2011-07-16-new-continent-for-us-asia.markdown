I just dropped Angelle off at the airport for her 5 week jaunt in India.  She's
fortunate to be going for work, so mostly all of her expenses are paid for, and
it is a wonderful opportunity for her to go.  I'll be meeting up with her in a
few weeks for the last leg of the trip as well, and I can't wait.

Neither of us have been to Asia before, so we are both very excited to see a new
continent.  New cultures, places, and experiences are always exciting, and I'm
thrilled to see what India has to offer us.

I'm going to be going for just over 2 weeks, and I'm planning to pack as light
as I can, though my laptop (for work) and DSLR will take up the most space.
I'll put together a post with my packing list once I've got everything nailed
down, but for now I've got a few weeks by myself here in DC for some running,
bike riding, and quiet reflection before I head off to a new continent.
