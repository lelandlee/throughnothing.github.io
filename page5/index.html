    <div class="body">
        <p>It&#39;s been about 5 months since I quit my day job and decided to plunge
head-first into the world of <a href="https://www.crowdtilt.com">startups</a>.
It&#39;s been an amazing ride so far, and I know I&#39;ve only begun to scratch
the surface of what&#39;s to come.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve been incredibly fortunate to have some
<a href="https://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/webmailus_acquired_by_rackspace.php">great</a>
<a href="http://www.siteworx.com">jobs</a> with some incredibly
intelligent and talented people.  I&#39;ve learned
a lot along the way, and the experiences have been great.  The breakneck
pace of the past 5 months at <a href="https://www.crowdtilt.com">crowdtilt</a>, however,
is something I hadn&#39;t experienced before.  It&#39;s amazing how fast
perspectives can change.</p>

<p>With a small team (we&#39;ve currently got 2 developers) everyone has lots
of autonomy, responsibility, and most importantly (for me, at least)
each person has the ability to have a <strong>huge</strong> impact on the business (and
on people&#39;s lives).  Every person on the team is empowered to make decisions,
move as quickly as possible, and really own the things they do.  This is often
lost at larger corporations, where there&#39;s more beauracracy and processes to
get in the way of what us developers really want to be doing (coding and
getting things done &trade;).  In this environment abstract teams own things,
while people and individuality are lost.  Thus far I&#39;ve been really happy with
our focus, our pace, and our ability to keep tedious processes and long
decision-chains to a bare minimum.</p>

<p>Ownership and impact are two things that I think are really big in a startup
environment -- in fact, they&#39;re huge.  To really own the tasks at hand while 
taking on the responsibility of getting them done and making the hundreds of
small decisions that inevitably come with any project is really rewarding
and also satisfying.  When you are given the power to make these decisions
it helps the company move faster, which is very exciting, but it also adds
creativity and brainpower to the companies growth engine -- after all,
startups don&#39;t just want instruction-followers, they want creators and doers.</p>

<p>As we look to grow our team, we&#39;re going to put a lot of focus on keeping these
things in tact.  We want to make sure everyone is empowered, self-motivated and
has access to all the tools they need to do great work.  We want to find
people who have a passion for creating great things, thrive with autonomy, and
want the opportunity to have a very large impact every single day.</p>
