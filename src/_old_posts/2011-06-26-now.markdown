All we have is now.  I try to remind myself of this when I get caught up in
reminiscing about the past, or worrying about the future.  The past no longer
is, and the future never will be.  All we have is the present moment; now and
always.

If we aren't happy in this present moment, can we ever be happy?  Being here,
now, is one of the things I'm continually working on.  I'm far from perfect, and
probably drift away from the present moment thousands of times a day.  The trick
is catching yourself when this happens, and being mindful of it.  Keep
persistently catching yourself, and reminding yourself that right now is all
you've got.  Breathe.  The more we can catch ourselves slipping out of the
present, the more aware we can become of ourselves, our surroundings, and the
lives we actually lead.  Now.
